						I am a bit crazy. Oh no I'm not kidding. Literally I am a bit crazy, thats why the crazy-hatter picture there. Not crazy enough as to be institutionalized my entire life though. I am Japanese and live in Sendai. You know the place? Well It is not coincidence, the area is center of earthquake affected region and city holds the largest population in the region. I started udacity to broaden my opportunities for the job, because I am looking for a job at the moment. I have been working as a freelance translator on various projects, translating from English to Japanese. If you are interested in hiring me as a janitor in your IT company, please do not hesitate to contact me.
